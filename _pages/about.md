I am a third-year Ph.D. student though [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/) graduate school, under the supervision of Professor [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt).
During my PhD, I also interned at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), Seattle under the mentorship of [Ruta Desai](https://rutadesai.github.io/).

My research seeks to answer the following question: **How to enable autonomous agents to learn, reason, and plan?** This allows me to explore novel ways of integrating machine learning and symbolic reasoning, via neuro-symbolic approaches, specifically in decision-making in dynamic environments. This fusion empowers AI models to be more robust, transparent, and capable of generalizing to complex tasks.

In 2019, I earned my Master's degree in AI from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, focusing on Active Learning for NLP applications, under the supervision of [Dr. Ambedkar Dukkipati](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~ambedkar/). Following that, I served as a Research Associate in the [Statistics and Machine Learning Group](https://sml.csa.iisc.ac.in/) at IISc, working on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Prior to beginning my doctoral journey, I worked with the Natural Understanding group @ [Amazon Alexa-AI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa), Bangalore.
