I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student though [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/) graduate school, supervised by [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt) and [Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires](https://pedrozudo.github.io/).
Last fall, I interned at [FAIR (Meta AI)](https://ai.meta.com/research/), London with [Nicolas Carion](https://www.nicolascarion.com/) working on VLMs and [Yoram Bachrach](https://sites.google.com/view/yoram-bachrach) on Agentic systems. In Fall 2022, I also interned at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), Seattle under [Ruta Desai](https://rutadesai.github.io/) and [Akshara Rai](https://ai.meta.com/people/423502423531745/akshara-rai/).

My research seeks to answer the questions like: **Can Large Language Models reason?** and **How to improve their reasoning abilities?** This allows me to explore novel ways of integrating *System 1* LLMs into *System 2* Reasoning. This fusion empowers LLMs to be more grounded, robust, and capable of generalizing to complex scenarios.

I completed my Masters in AI from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in 2019. My focus was on Active Learning for NLP, supervised by [Dr. Ambedkar Dukkipati](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~ambedkar/). I have also had brief stints at Natural Understanding group @ [Amazon Alexa-AI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa) and as a Research Associate at [Statistics and Machine Learning Group](https://sml.csa.iisc.ac.in/), exploring Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
