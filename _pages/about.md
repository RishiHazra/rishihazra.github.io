[//]: # (I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student though [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program &#40;WASP&#41;]&#40;https://wasp-sweden.org/&#41; graduate school, supervised by [Luc De Raedt]&#40;https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt&#41; and [Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires]&#40;https://pedrozudo.github.io/&#41;.)

[//]: # (Last fall, I interned at [FAIR &#40;Meta AI&#41;]&#40;https://ai.meta.com/research/&#41;, London with [Nicolas Carion]&#40;https://www.nicolascarion.com/&#41; working on VLMs and [Yoram Bachrach]&#40;https://sites.google.com/view/yoram-bachrach&#41; on Agentic systems. In Fall 2022, I also interned at [Meta Reality Labs]&#40;https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/&#41;, Seattle under [Ruta Desai]&#40;https://rutadesai.github.io/&#41; and [Akshara Rai]&#40;https://ai.meta.com/people/423502423531745/akshara-rai/&#41;.)

I'm starting as a Postdoctoral research at [FAIR (Meta AI)](https://ai.meta.com/research/), London, working with [Yoram Bachrach](https://sites.google.com/view/yoram-bachrach) on AI Research Agents. Previously, I have interned twice at Meta, working closely with [Nicolas Carion](https://www.nicolascarion.com/), [Yoram Bachrach](https://sites.google.com/view/yoram-bachrach), [Ruta Desai](https://rutadesai.github.io/) and [Akshara Rai](https://ai.meta.com/people/423502423531745/akshara-rai/)

My doctoral research, supervised by [Luc De Raedt](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/people/lucderaedt) and [Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires](https://pedrozudo.github.io/), primarily focused on developing LLM Agents equipped with search capabilities for improved reasoning and decision-making.

I completed my Masters in AI from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in 2019, supervised by [Dr. Ambedkar Dukkipati](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~ambedkar/). I have also had brief stints at Natural Understanding group @ [Amazon Alexa-AI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa) and as a Research Associate at [Statistics and Machine Learning Group](https://sml.csa.iisc.ac.in/), exploring Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
